This is a simple web-based Wishlist application that allows users to add, mark as complete, and delete items from their wishlist. The application leverages local storage to persist the wishlist items, so your data remains even after closing the browser.

*   **Mark as Complete:** Toggle the completion status of a wishlist item by clicking on its checkbox or text.
*   **Delete Items:** Remove unwanted items from your wishlist using the delete button.
*   **Persistent Storage:** All wishlist items are saved to your browser's local storage, ensuring your data is not lost upon refresh or closing the browser.
*   **Unique IDs:** Each wishlist item is assigned a unique ID using a UUID generation function.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling the application.
